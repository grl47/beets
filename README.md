## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F.

2. Prepare a sheet pan (optionally, you can also cover it with aluminum foil) by covering the surface with a thin layer of  olive or vegetable oil.

3. Dice all your vegetables.
    > The larger your cubes the longer they will take to cook. 

4. Toss vegetable cubes with oil and coarse salt. 

5. Spread the vegetables in a single layer on the prepared pan.
    > You will want squashes on a separate pan from the root vegetables as they cook faster.  

6. Place in the preheated oven and cook until you can easilly pierce the vegetables with a fork, about 1 hour.
    > Flip the vegetables about halfway through cooking.
